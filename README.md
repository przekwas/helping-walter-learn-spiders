# Webcrawler/Spider
Hey Walt!  This is super simple but it's a great starting point to get results and to play with.
It uses the [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) library to give us the ability to get a project running and scraping data super quick!  Check the link for the API docs for other features that I can help you figure out.

I commented all three javascript files to help you understand, there are a few medium-level javascript concepts in use so hit me up if you have any questions and I can help or give you the resources to understand 'em!

Happy Hacking!

## Requirements
- Code Editor of some kind, again, I reccomend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) that comes with bundled with NPM
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) for Windows or your Terminal for OSX
- Understanding of [http://books.toscrape.com/](http://books.toscrape.com/) to see what data I'm scraping for testing this project

### Running

 1. Clone this repo onto your computer
 2. Navigate to the directory in Cmder/Terminal
 3. Once inside the directory, run `npm install` and it should download and install puppeteer for you
 4. Run `node test_scrape_simple.js` in Cmder/Terminal and it should save a screenshot for google.com as your first successful scrape!  
 5. Then run `node test_scrape_button.js` to see how to navigate to a different screen and get information there
 6. Run `node test_scrape_loop.js` to see how I made a loop to get every title/price on the first page on our testing website
